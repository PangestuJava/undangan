1. **Create a Tenant**:

    - Register a new tenant via the admin dashboard or CLI:
        ```bash
        php artisan tenancy:create tenant_name
        ```
    - This creates a new tenant with an isolated database.

2. **Design Invitations**:

    - Log in as a tenant user and use the invitation builder to create and customize your invitation.

3. **Invite Guests**:

    - Add guests and send invitations via email or shareable links.

4. **Track RSVPs**:

    - Monitor guest responses and attendance status in real-time.

5. **Admin Access**:

    - Use the central dashboard to view all tenant databases and manage tenants:

        ```php
        use App\Models\Tenant;

        $tenants = Tenant::all();
        foreach ($tenants as $tenant) {
            echo "Tenant: {$tenant->id}, Database: {$tenant->getDatabaseName()}\n";
        }
